# Helicopter Emulator Project 
![ UML ](./FIG/UML.png)

#  Introduction
This project aims for groups of students to design a real-time control software that operates on a Tiva microcontroller (MCU). This software interacts with a supplied helicopter emulator program running on a separate microcontroller. Through this project, students will gain practical experience in real-time operating systems, embedded software, and control algorithms.
